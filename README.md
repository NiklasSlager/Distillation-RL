# Aspen-RL
Reinforcement learning for chemical engineering process design with Aspen Simulator. 
This is for the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04327) by Stephan C.P.A. van Kalmthout.

Ultimately, we found Aspen simulator to be too slow to be a good option for RL. 
For other work on the topic of RL for process synthesis see https://github.com/lollcat/RL-Process-Design and https://github.com/lollcat/DistillationTrain-Gym.
